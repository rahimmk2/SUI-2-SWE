# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    Team meeting will take place twice a week (usually on Friday and Saturday). Meetings will be hybrid - most will be done through discord's group call feature and we will decide on the possibility and location of in-person meetings at the start of each week. A meeting log of the approximate time of the meetings will be recorded, alongside some notes detailing the most important parts of the meeting.

2. **Assistance** 

    Team members are able to contact each other using discord, text, and phone calls. The majority of the discussion will happen on discord, where teammates can expect an answer within 8 hours of the message if sent within reasonable hours. Phone calls and texts will be utilized if the pending decision or question if urgent.

3. **Respect** 

    We will plan on a shared google document, letting us share ideas without the restictions such as one person leading (or dominating) the discussion. Some matters will be put through a majority vote before a final decision is made and the most important matters will be put through a unanimous vote before progress is made.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    
    The project will be divided into multiple mini-projects. In most situations, each group member will be working on a different mini-project but constult each other before major decisions are made. Multiple members maybe working on the same mini-project at the same time (such as one person psudo-coding and the other implementing) if the given mini-project is large by volume or significance. The group will later work together to assemble each mini-project back into its entirety.

5. **Time Commitment**

    Each member is expected to put in 3 to 5 hours of each week, outside of group meetings. In the case a member is unable to complete this expectation in the upcoming week, the member is expected to notify the group during the weekly meeting. This will allow the group to adjust to the new workload. In the case a member is unable to notify the group during the meeting or repeatedly unable to complete the minimum work, they will be expected to put in extra hours at a later stage in the project.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    
    We will try to set internal due dates to be earlier than the actual due dates as a means to prevent the habitually-late memebers from significantly holding back progess and ease the process of workload redistribution if needed. If more than one member constantly fails to complete the thier portion of work, we will seek to hold more "work meetings" - dedicated times to meet and just work on the project -  outside of our regular meeting times so that we can ensure that everyone is making progress and help is given when needed.
